# QueShare

The app has been tested/designed for the Nuexus 6 (emulator), and the Motorola G8 power (physical device).

The minimum SDK on the project is 22, however this was for testing on an older Moto G2, but sockets do not work here, but app runs. 

As stated in CompB, minimum supported is 23.

This app needs two phones connected on the same network for the QR code sharing to work. 

Haven't been able to test if it works on mobile data due to only having one sim card available to me.

Let me know if you still have only one android device available to you and I'm sure I can knock up a quick client to replicate a secondary phone.
